# Java Lambdas Expressions Demo App

## Problem
Develop a Java app that has three separate functions which determine then return the minimum, maximum, and average of the following numbers, which the calling method then prints.
17.64, 55.56, 36.93, 55.96, 20.23, 41.74, 1.8, 95.97, 81.89, 36.16, 34.41, 87.9, 13.74, 11.15

That also sorts the numbers using Collections.sort(), then calls a function to calculate and return the median, then prints the median

That also has three separate Lambda expressions which determine then return the minimum, maximum, and average of the same numbers, which the calling method then prints.
17.64, 55.56, 36.93, 55.96, 20.23, 41.74, 1.8, 95.97, 81.89, 36.16, 34.41, 87.9, 13.74, 11.15

That also sorts the numbers using Collections.sort(), then calls a Lambda Block to calculate and return the median, then prints the median.

Determine the percent difference in execution time between the function and lambda implementation of min(), max(), average(), and median() for each using Java.lang.System.nanoTime() for something that takes about a second to run like a million or so executions.
